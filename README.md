Numerical Methods project Discussion 

Guys I made this repository to work on our project together

our first assignment is to download datatset folder and sperate all the images from the folders and but them all together
then we have to annotate at least 300 picture 

annotation in short: 
1-but any raw image in a software
2-choose the annotation type (polygon in our case)
3-mark the desired area (like cracks or potholes)
4-export as JSON file
